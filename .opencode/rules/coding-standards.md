# Coding Standards

**RULE TYPE**: Mandatory engineering standards.

## Core Rules

1. Minimal change: modify only what is required by the goal.
2. Readability first: clear naming, short functions, shallow nesting.
3. Comments must explain business decisions and algorithm choices, not obvious code logic.
4. Treat inputs and shared state as immutable.
5. Avoid `any` unless an explicit boundary requires it.
6. Validate all external inputs before use.
7. Handle errors with actionable context.

## Immutability Rule

- Never mutate function arguments.
- Never mutate shared state directly.
- Local mutation is allowed only on fresh local copies with clear justification.

## Error Handling Rule

- Wrap failure-prone operations.
- Preserve original error context in logs.
- Return/throw stable, user-safe error messages.

## Type & Validation Rule

- Prefer strict types and explicit interfaces.
- Add runtime validation for request payloads, env vars, and external data.

## Size Guidelines

- **Code files**: Function <= 50 lines. File: 200-400 lines preferred, <= 800 hard limit. Nesting depth: <= 4. Rule/config files are exempt.

## Quality Gate

- Naming and flow are readable; error paths are handled.
- No hardcoded secrets; input validation is present.
- Tests cover changed behavior; no leftover debug logs.

## Testing Norms

- Never mark a task complete without proof (test results, behavior delta, or log snippet).
- Bugfix: reproduce with failing test first, apply minimal fix, then refactor.
- Coverage baseline: >= 80% overall; high-risk modules (auth, security, business logic) target 100%.
- Use AAA structure; behavior-driven test names.

## Testing Escalation Rules

Escalate before closing the task when:

1. Key tests cannot run in the current environment.
2. Regression risk exists but reproducible evidence is incomplete.
3. Required coverage is unmet for high-risk modules.

## Anti-Rationalization Pattern

This pattern prevents rationalization failures where models skip verification steps.

**Pre-Execution Traps — when you feel like skipping, do it instead:**
- "The code looks right" → Execute and verify, don't just read
- "Tests already passed" → Run them yourself, trust nothing
- "The logic is simple" → Prove it with tests
- "I already read the file" → Files change, re-read before editing
- "It worked before" → Dependencies change, retest
- "No errors in output" → Check exit codes and side effects

**Decision Traps — question every assumption:**
- "This is the right approach" → What would make this wrong?
- "No breaking changes" → Did you verify all callers?
- "Performance is fine" → Did you measure it?
- "It's tested" → Is coverage >80% on changed paths?
- "Edge cases are handled" → Did you enumerate them?

**Skip-proof checklist:**
- [ ] Did I run the code, not just read it?
- [ ] Did I verify the test results myself?
- [ ] Did I check for side effects, confirm exit codes?
- [ ] Did I measure performance when it matters?

Reference this when starting implementation, reviewing work, or declaring a task complete.
